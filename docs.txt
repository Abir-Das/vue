#public/:
        This directory contains static files that are directly copied to the build output without any processing.
        It typically includes the project's main HTML file (index.html), favicon, and other assets.

      ##src/:
             The src directory is the heart of your Vue.js application.
      ##assets/:
                This directory is used for storing static assets like images, fonts, or CSS files.
      ##components/:
                  You'll place your reusable Vue components in this directory. Each component typically consists of a .vue file (template, script, and styles).
      ##views/: 
              This directory is for higher-level components or views that represent the different pages or major sections of your application.
      ##App.vue:
              The root component of your application. It serves as the entry point for all other components.
      ##main.js: 
              The main JavaScript file where you create the Vue instance and configure any plugins or additional libraries.
#tests/:
        This directory is used for storing your application's tests.
        You can use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha to write and run tests for your Vue components and functionality.


#node_modules/: 
              The directory where all the project's dependencies are installed.
              This folder is generated automatically when you run npm install to install the project dependencies.

#package.json: 
              The manifest file for your project, which includes the project's metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
#.gitignore:
          A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control systems like Git.

#babel.config.js: 
          The configuration file for Babel, a JavaScript compiler. It defines the presets and plugins that Babel should use to transpile your JavaScript code.

#README.md: 
        A markdown file that typically contains information about the project, its setup, and instructions for running and contributing to it.

#vue.config.js:
        A configuration file for Vue CLI. You can use this file to customize the project's build process, configure webpack, and more.
